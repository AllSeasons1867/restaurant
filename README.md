# README

This repository contains a Ruby on Rails application that delivers a restaurant menu to site visitors. 

The application utilizes both Bootstrap and custom stylesheets to deliver a minimalist design aesthetic. Users can filter menu items based on tastes and preferences. Options include vegan, dairy free, and gluten free. 

When the application is downloaded to your local machine you will have to configure the database permissions in the database.yml file to be congruent with your system.

Run 'rails db:create' and then 'rails db:migrate' to instantiate the database.

Run the server with the command 'rails s'.
